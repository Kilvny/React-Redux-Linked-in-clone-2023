# LinkedIn Clone
This is a LinkedIn clone built with React, Redux, Firebase, and MaterialUI. The project aims to replicate the style and functionality of LinkedIn, with features such as the ability to post to the feed, interact with posts using emojis, share posts, and authenticate users using Firebase.

# Features
- Ability to post to the feed and see posts of others
- Interact with posts with emojis
- Ability to share a post
- Authentication using Firebase
- Challenge: Persistence of Data and State
- What I did to resolve it: Firebase Firestore and Redux-Persist
